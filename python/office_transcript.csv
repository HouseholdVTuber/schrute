So...","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?","01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: [on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Well. I don't know.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: What?,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Any messages?,"01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Uh, yeah. Just a fax.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: You haven't told me.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: People say I am the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious."" ""And you get the best out of us."" [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.",01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: [singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming],"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Whassup!,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Whassup! I still love that after seven years.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Whassup!,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Whassup!,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Whass...up!,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Whassup.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: [Strains, grunts] What?",01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Nothing.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: OK. All right. See you later.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: All right. Take care.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Back to work.,01x01 - Pilot;Jan: [on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.","01x01 - Pilot;Jan: Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Um... Me no get an agenda.,01x01 - Pilot;Jan: What? I'm sorry?,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I didn't get any agenda.,"01x01 - Pilot;Jan: Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?,"01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Uh, yeah, the one...","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.",01x01 - Pilot;Jan: Do you want to look at mine?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.","01x01 - Pilot;Jan: OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: OK...,"01x01 - Pilot;Jan: Michael, don't panic.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.","01x01 - Pilot;Jan: No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!,01x01 - Pilot;Jan: I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: OK. No problem.,"01x01 - Pilot;Jan: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?",01x01 - Pilot;Jan: Go ahead.,01x01 - Pilot;Michel: Packman.,"01x01 - Pilot;Todd Packer: Hey, you big queen.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Oh, that's not appropriate.","01x01 - Pilot;Todd Packer: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Uh, I don't know what you mean.",01x01 - Pilot;Todd Packer: I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.",01x01 - Pilot;Jan: So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.",01x01 - Pilot;Phyllis: So what does downsizing actually mean?,01x01 - Pilot;Stanley: Well...,01x01 - Pilot;Oscar: You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.,01x01 - Pilot;Angela: I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.,"01x01 - Pilot;Kevin: Yeah, it'll be you.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: I have an important question for you.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Yes?,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Hey.,01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: Hey.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: This is Mr. Scott.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Guilty! Guilty as charged!,01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.",01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: Yup.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]","01x01 - Pilot;Pam: I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?",01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: What?,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: What are you doing?,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: It's not on your desk.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.",01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: You can't do that.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Why not?,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: [crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Downsizing?,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: You just still have these messages from yesterday.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: What?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Don't we all?,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I'm sorry?,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Nothing.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.",01x01 - Pilot;,01x01 - Pilot;,01x01 - Pilot;,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.,01x01 - Pilot;Oscar: Can't you just tell us.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: You don't know what it is. [Laughs],01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I don't need your permission.,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Go ahead.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.,01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.,"01x01 - Pilot;Oscar: Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Not gonna happen.,01x01 - Pilot;Stanley: It could be out of your hands Michael.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",01x01 - Pilot;Stanley: Can you promise that?,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: On his mother's grave.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: No.,01x01 - Pilot;Phyllis: What?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",01x01 - Pilot;Stanley: It's just that we need to know.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.,01x01 - Pilot;Man: Are you sure about that?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.","01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Pam, information is power.","01x01 - Pilot;Stanley: You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.","01x01 - Pilot;Jim: If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.","01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.",01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: What's up? Nice to meet you.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Introduce yourself. Be polite.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.","01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: That's his profit.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.",01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Damn it! Jim!,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: He put my stuff in Jell-O again.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: [Laughing],01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: What is that?,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: That is my stapler.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.","01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?",01x01 - Pilot;Jim: How do you know it was me?,01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: Yeah.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.","01x01 - Pilot;Jim: OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: [Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.,01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: You should've put him in custardy.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.,"01x01 - Pilot;Dwight: OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.",01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Yeah.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: So when are we going out?,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Tonight, hopefully.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: OK. Yeah.,"01x01 - Pilot;Roy: Hey, man.",01x01 - Pilot;Jim: What's going on?,"01x01 - Pilot;Roy: Hey, baby.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Hey.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?,"01x01 - Pilot;Roy: No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.,"01x01 - Pilot;Roy: It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.","01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Yeah, yeah.",01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Um... What's in the bag?,01x01 - Pilot;Roy: Just tell her I'll talk to her later.,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.",01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head],"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?",01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: Yeah.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",01x01 - Pilot;Ryan: All right.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: You got a fax.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: What? Why?,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Why? Well, theft and stealing.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Post-it Notes.,"01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?","01x01 - Pilot;Michael: 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Are you serious?,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: Yeah. I am.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: [Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: You're a jerk.,01x01 - Pilot;Michael: I don't know about that.,"01x01 - Pilot;Michael: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, ""Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?"" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Hey.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Hey.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: How are things?,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?","01x01 - Pilot;Pam: It's better, thanks.",01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Good. Good.,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Yeah.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: That's great,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Is...?,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Yeah?,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Um... Are you...,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Am I walking out?,01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Yes.,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Yes, I... Do you want to...",01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Yeah.,01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Great. Let me just...,"01x01 - Pilot;Jim: [Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.","01x01 - Pilot;Pam: Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.","01x01 - Pilot;Jim: Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.

OK.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: I have two. White and Indian.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Yes.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: A few of the ground rules?,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: OK, can we steer away from gay people?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Um...,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Well, we only have an hour.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: I figured it would save time.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Mr. Brown.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK, I will play guy listening.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Kevin: I remember.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Kevin: Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!",01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Wait a second.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: [Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Stop it!,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: [As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?","01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: OK.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: We all have a hero in our heart.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: [Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: I can't leave until you do.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Michael, can I talk to you candidly?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Sure.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK, well I know. You told me that several times.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: Don't worry about dating.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: I won't.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Mr. Brown: OK. Thank you.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Yeah, yeah.",01x02 - Diversity Day;,01x02 - Diversity Day;,01x02 - Diversity Day;,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: ""I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..."" Open-mindedness, is that even a word? ""...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."" [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: ""I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart."" I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, ""Mr. Brown,"" he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Toby: Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Get out.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Toby: I'm sorry.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: [on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, ""If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North."" And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: [/b]: Uh, is that it?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Kevin: It was kind of hard to hear.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...",01x02 - Diversity Day;Kelly: I have a customer meeting.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: What part Native American?,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Two fifteenths.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Oh, yeah...","01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Wow.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: My parents were Mexican.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: Thank... Yeah...,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: Mexican isn't offensive.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Well, it has certain connotations.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: Like what?,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Like... I don't... I don't know.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: What connotations, Michael? You meant something.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: No. Now, remember that honesty...",01x02 - Diversity Day;Oscar: I'm just curious.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: ...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!",01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: Hello? Hello?,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Oh this is a good one.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Pam: Um, hi. How are you?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Stanley: Fine. How are you?,01x02 - Diversity Day;Pam: Great.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Push it.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Stanley: I admire your culture's success in America.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Pam: Thank you.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Stanley: Who am I supposed to be?,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Pam: That's nice, Dwight.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Pam: OK, I like your food.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Dwight: Outback steakhouse.

I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. ""Too soon for Arabs."" Maybe next year. Um...

I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: No way. I think she likes this stuff.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Ryan: Great. She's cute, huh?","01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...","01x02 - Diversity Day;Ryan: Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: Oh, yeah.

OK.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: [Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?",01x02 - Diversity Day;Kelly: I just had the longest meeting.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: [trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Jim: [on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.","01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name.

Man I should have gotten some food.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Kevin: [Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",01x02 - Diversity Day;Stanley: It's collard greens.,01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: What?,01x02 - Diversity Day;Stanley: It's collard greens.,"01x02 - Diversity Day;Michael: That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil.

[nods toward camera]","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money.

Yeah, like a specialist.","01x03 - Health Care;Jan: So, which health plan have you decided on?","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: I am going to go with the best, Jan.

Have you looked at them closely Michael?",01x03 - Health Care;Michael: I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.,01x03 - Health Care;Jan: The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.,"01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.",01x03 - Health Care;Jan: Michael.,01x03 - Health Care;Michael: You gotta crack these things open.,"01x03 - Health Care;Jan: You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.",01x03 - Health Care;Jan: It's your job.

Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Really?,"01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Yeah.

I'm your man.,"01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career.

Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, ""Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.""

Rain check?","01x03 - Health Care;Meredith: Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Ah, what? Which memo?",01x03 - Health Care;Pam: Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Is it a good plan?,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,01x03 - Health Care;Oscar: It's like a pay decrease.,"01x03 - Health Care;Pam: Michael, he made huge cuts.","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Yeah, you said...","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: I can handle that.,"01x03 - Health Care;Michael: OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",01x03 - Health Care;Oscar: This is not good.,01x03 - Health Care;Angela: It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?,01x03 - Health Care;Oscar: What was that?,01x03 - Health Care;Angela: You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.,01x03 - Health Care;Kevin: What are you guys talking about?,"01x03 - Health Care;Angela: Nothing, Kevin.","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, ""Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.","01x03 - Health Care;Jim: OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Workspace.,01x03 - Health Care;,01x03 - Health Care;,01x03 - Health Care;,01x03 - Health Care;Michael: You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,01x03 - Health Care;Pam: Where are you going?,"01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.","01x03 - Health Care;Travel Agent: I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,01x03 - Health Care;Pam: I'm inventing new diseases.,"01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Oh, great.","01x03 - Health Care;Pam: So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,01x03 - Health Care;Pam: Nice.,01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Thank you.,"01x03 - Health Care;Michael: [on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.",01x03 - Health Care;Man on Phone: You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.,01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.,"01x03 - Health Care;Man on Phone: It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.",01x03 - Health Care;Michael: So it's not a free fall?,01x03 - Health Care;Man on Phone: It's an industrial coal elevator.,"01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Damnit! Damnit Jim!,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: What are you talking about?,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.","01x03 - Health Care;Jim: OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: You did this, didn't you?",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Absolutely not.,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Yes you did.,01x03 - Health Care;Jim: No I didn't.,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Killer nanorobots?,01x03 - Health Care;Pam: It's an epidemic.,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] ""Count Choculitis""",01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Sounds tough.,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Do you?,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: I think you need to confess...,01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Mmm hmm.,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: ...the fact...,01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Yep.,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: What are you doing? Those are my keys.,01x03 - Health Care;Jim: Good luck. [closes door and locks it],"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...

Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.",01x03 - Health Care;Jan: Who is this?,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Dwight Schrute.,01x03 - Health Care;Jan: From sales?,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Well...,01x03 - Health Care;Jan: Where's Michael Scott?,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,"01x03 - Health Care;Jan: Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",01x03 - Health Care;Jan: Really?,01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Yeah.,"01x03 - Health Care;Jan: OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Call you immediately.

Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.",01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Michael. Michael?,"01x03 - Health Care;Michael: [under his breath] Oh, Christ.","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.","01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",01x03 - Health Care;Stanley: What about confidentiality?,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: You know what? You have forfeited that privilege.

Because if you do, I want that covered.",01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: I thought your v*g1n* was removed during your hysterectomy?,01x03 - Health Care;Meredith: A uterus is different from a v*g1n*. I still have a v*g1n*.,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?",01x03 - Health Care;Kevin: That's a real thing.,"01x03 - Health Care;Dwight: Yeah, but no one here has it.",01x03 - Health Care;Kevin: Someone has it.,01x03 - Health Care;Kevin: Do you think we should go ?,"01x03 - Health Care;Oscar: I don't know, Kevin.

There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: [clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...","01x03 - Health Care;Michael: Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo.

Dwight, come on...",01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?,01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: There's no downsizing.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?",01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Yeah, so I don't have to worry?","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: But there's no downsizing, so just don't...",01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, ""You're fired."" [as Donald Trump] ""You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed."" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] ""You're foir-ed."" I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, ""You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want."" But that's unrealistic, so...","01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.",01x04 - The Alliance;Stanley: Why'd you do this?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam.

Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?",01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Who is it? Who's the birthday?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: Um...

Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.",01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: You still want to have a party?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: [grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp.

Never mind.","01x04 - The Alliance;Angela: No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.",01x04 - The Alliance;Phyllis: Yeah?,01x04 - The Alliance;Angela: What color do you guys think?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Phyllis: Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...",01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: How about green?,01x04 - The Alliance;Angela: I think green is kind of whoreish.,01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.,01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.","01x04 - The Alliance;Angela: Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...",01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: It is... her birthday.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?","01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance.

And then here he comes and he says ""No, Jim, here's a way.""",01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.,01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: An alliance?,01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: Oh yeah.,01x04 - The Alliance;Pam: What does that even mean?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.","01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.","01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?",01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Did you tell Pam about the alliance?,01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: What? No.,01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Just now.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office?

Do you see what I'm doing?,01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Mmm hmm.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Done.,01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: All right.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: [to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, ""Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers."" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high.

What was it? 25 bucks?","01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.","01x04 - The Alliance;Jim: Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.",01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Is Oscar around?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation.

""Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back."" 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",01x04 - The Alliance;Meredith: You're right. You're right. Yes.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Divorce. Um... OK, ""Meredith is so old...""",01x04 - The Alliance;Oscar: How old is she?,"01x04 - The Alliance;Michael: Everybody? If... could do it?

What the hell is he talking about?,01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: I have absolutely no idea.,01x04 - The Alliance;Roy: Come on.,"01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.","01x04 - The Alliance;Dwight: [With blonde hair] That's politics baby.

A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning."
"02x01 - The Dundies;Michael: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, ""Hey, did you get an award?"" And the neighbor will say, ""No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me."" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...","02x01 - The Dundies;Jim: So, you ready for the... the Dundies?",02x01 - The Dundies;Pam: Ugh...,"02x01 - The Dundies;Pam: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.",02x01 - The Dundies;Michael: [in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.,02x01 - The Dundies;Jim: What?,02x01 - The Dundies;Michael: [in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert.

Who wrote it?,"02x01 - The Dundies;Pam: Um, it's kind of private.",02x01 - The Dundies;Phyllis: [whispering] It's about Michael.,"02x01 - The Dundies;Dwight: That is defacement of company property.

[tears open envelope and pulls out card] ""Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."" Here's the problem.

God.,"02x05 - Halloween;Jim: Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",02x05 - Halloween;Michael: [clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?,02x05 - Halloween;Jim: Um... yes.,"02x05 - Halloween;Jim: Michael, I really didn't mean to...",02x05 - Halloween;Michael: Help.

You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny.

Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo."

Looks like USA Today.","02x07 - The Client;Jan: Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...","02x07 - The Client;Jim: So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.

That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare] Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao.

[to Dwight] Is that all?",02x07 - The Client;Jim: Jan didn't come back for her car last night.,02x07 - The Client;Pam: What!?,02x07 - The Client;Jim: Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?,"02x07 - The Client;Pam: Oh, I don't know...

Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. [to camera] Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right.

See you soon."" First impressions?","02x08 - Performance Review;Pam: Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.","02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.","02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: [playing Jan's message] ""I guess I missed you."" I guess I missed you.

Yeah, what, what?",02x08 - Performance Review;Pam: Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.,"02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.

Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses.","02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.","02x08 - Performance Review;Stanley: Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact.",02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: No kidding.,02x08 - Performance Review;Stanley: It's all about my bonus.,02x08 - Performance Review;Pam: Michael and Jan definitely made out.,02x08 - Performance Review;Jim: Ohh...,02x08 - Performance Review;Pam: Maybe more.,"02x08 - Performance Review;Jim: Eck!...

Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn.",02x08 - Performance Review;Angela: I actually look forward to performance reviews.

Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.","02x08 - Performance Review;Jan: No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.","02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.","02x08 - Performance Review;Jan: Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.",02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Oh.,02x08 - Performance Review;Jan: I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.,02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Been thinking about you.,"02x08 - Performance Review;Jan: Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.","02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional.

I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder?

There's tons of ideas in there.,02x08 - Performance Review;Pam: What suggestion box?,"02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?

And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job."" But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business.",02x08 - Performance Review;,02x08 - Performance Review;,02x08 - Performance Review;,02x08 - Performance Review;Jan: So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?,"02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual.

Who was it? Who did he fire?,02x08 - Performance Review;Pam: You didn't see it?,"02x08 - Performance Review;Dwight: No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap!

Very good.,"02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one[/b]: ""What should we do to prepare for Y2K?""",02x08 - Performance Review;Dwight: What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,02x08 - Performance Review;Kelly: I thought you read these every week.,"02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.

Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",02x08 - Performance Review;Toby: Aren't the suggestions meant for you?,"02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.","02x08 - Performance Review;Creed: Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring.","02x08 - Performance Review;Michael: Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.

And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card.

Maybe I should call him and tell him that.","02x10 - Christmas Party;Michael: I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera.

I'm counting on you!,"02x11 - Booze Cruise;Dwight: I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Captain Jack: All right, all right, that was great!

The customer. Because the customer is king.","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Michael: Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",02x11 - Booze Cruise;Captain Jack: He's just sucking up!,"02x11 - Booze Cruise;Roy: When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Captain Jack: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

I just wanted to clear that up.,"02x11 - Booze Cruise;Roy: Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Michael: I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Roy: No, it was Captain Jack.","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Michael: Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!","02x11 - Booze Cruise;Captain Jack: We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!",02x11 - Booze Cruise;Michael: Yes!

Why did you even bring me here tonight?,02x11 - Booze Cruise;Jim: I don't know. Let's break up.,02x11 - Booze Cruise;Katy: Whoa. What?,02x11 - Booze Cruise;Captain Jack: This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.,02x11 - Booze Cruise;Meredith: Wow!,02x11 - Booze Cruise;Dwight: Seasick?

What?,"02x11 - Booze Cruise;Michael: Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...",02x11 - Booze Cruise;Captain Jack: Hey! Hey!

I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",02x13 - The Secret;Michael: It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.,02x13 - The Secret;Pam: Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?,"02x13 - The Secret;Michael: Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.",02x13 - The Secret;Jim: Ready?,02x13 - The Secret;Pam: Yep.,"02x13 - The Secret;Michael: People are always coming to me. ""Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust."" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott."

[walks into office],02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: [coughing] It's still stinky.,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: That is worse.,02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation.,"02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: [while in his reeking office] I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.

Welcome back!,02x14 - The Carpet;Pam: Thanks!,"02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot?",02x14 - The Carpet;Pam: A little.,02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: Good! What's goin' on here?,02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting.,02x14 - The Carpet;Ryan: [barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.,02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: [smelling the stink] Oh. Wow.,02x14 - The Carpet;Pam: [giggles at Roy],02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: [sitting at Jim's desk] Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.,02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: That might be a little difficult with the one computer.,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Oh... It's ...,02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: But there's definitely a desk open in the back.,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: [reluctantly] Yeah ...,02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: ...which I guess I'll be taking.,"02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: No, no, no!

I used to sit right here.",02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: No way!,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Yeah.,02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: And who had your office?,"02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust] Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, ""Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work."" What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.","02x14 - The Carpet;Kelly: [to Jim] I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...",02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: You know who used to sit at that desk?,02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Mm-mm.

He'd come in and sit there sometimes.",02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: Ah.,"02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls]. Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy.",02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.,"02x14 - The Carpet;Stanley: [on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?","02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.","02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired.",02x14 - The Carpet;Creed: [after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Charley horse!,02x14 - The Carpet;Creed: What?,02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Charley horse!,"02x14 - The Carpet;Creed: You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.","02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Oh, okay.

Snow cones...","02x14 - The Carpet;Ryan: Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.",02x14 - The Carpet;Jim: It's the lever on the side.,02x14 - The Carpet;Ryan: That's what I told him.

I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure] But it... it was still wrong.","02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.",02x14 - The Carpet;Michael: You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.,02x14 - The Carpet;,02x14 - The Carpet;,02x14 - The Carpet;,"02x14 - The Carpet;Dwight: [on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller?

"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: [knocks] Hey, what's going on?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: What are you doing?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Michael.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Michael.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: They did this up in Albany...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: You are not allowed in this session.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Now you're really not allowed in this session.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I'm your boss.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: [stands up] Anybody want any coffee or...,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Women in the workplace... yeah, translation ""I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls."" Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Jan.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Yes, Pam?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Michael's still at the door.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Michael!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: [in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: It's a terrible idea.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: What is?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: [in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Yeah!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: That's what I'm talking about!,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: ... but it's very destructive.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: We have nowhere else Jan. This...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: We could do it in the warehouse.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Remember on Lost when they met the Others?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Mmmhmm.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Please? Thank you. very much.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Why?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: I don't understand.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kevin: [talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Thanks for the head's up, Kev.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kevin: I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: [points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little ""Good Will Hunting"" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Meredith: Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Great. Phyllis?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Angela: [disbelieving] Really?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: No. Okay. Stop. Go on...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Angela: I've seen some of your spreadsheets.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: Really? I thought they were pretty...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Oh, no, no. No.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Yeah. I like talking to her too.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: So, we're cool, right?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Yes. Yeah.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: All right.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Yep. Cool, man.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Sweet.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kevin: [blows a sigh of relief],"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: The experience...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Okay. Let's go. Step up.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Meredith: In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: That is an excellent goal.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Meredith: Four and a half.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Great! Uh-huh?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Women: [general murmuring of agreement],"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Ponies.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: No.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Ryan: How about rainbows?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: No.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Flowers.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Mike.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Stand clear.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Look, would ya... look.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: We're the ones that got to clean that up!,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Lonny: Dammit, Michael!",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: We ought to have this thing serviced.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Madge: Hey, do you want me to go?","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: No, why? Why would I... ? You could...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Madge: I'll go.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Stay or...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: ...and a big walk-in closet.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Meredith: Oh, that's part of my dream too.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: Oh, me too.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: She's real good.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Thanks.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: There are always a million reasons not to do something.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;,02x15 - Boys & Girls;,02x15 - Boys & Girls;,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: My priority is safety.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: OK.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I... That was just...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: That bothers me too.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I was breathing.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Lonny: You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: All right. Let's talk about clothing.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Angela: I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like ""When are we going to go on a date-date?""",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Guy: I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement],02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: I hate that too.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kevin: That sucks so much.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Guy: It totally sucks.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like ""Gas ain't free!""","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Lonny: Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I feel you.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Not literally.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Yes.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Ah, you do. So...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: But we get paid a lot less.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Dwight: Word.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Like next to no benefits.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I know. God! What is that?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Exactly.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: It blows. It blows, man. Gah...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: You know this would not happen if we had a union.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: That's what I'm talking about.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: Absolutely.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: That's what we need.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Guy: You know you're right.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Roy: In my truck.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Dockworker's?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Man, hook you up.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Men: [generalized clapping],"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Guy: Come on, man.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Union! Union, yeah.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Are you with us Mike?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Yeah-es.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: Welcome to the warehouse.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Group chant: Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: [knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: What? A union! What...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Don't get hysterical.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I'm not...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: But we're bonding down there!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: That's too bad.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I don't want to...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Michael! Michael! Michael!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: We have a history...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Michael.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: ...between us.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Don't say another word.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I won't,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Get yourself down stairs.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Ryan: You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Stanley: This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: Mistake.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Meredith: Slip.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Excuse me?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: I mean that's a baseball term, right?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: [in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: [in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: [in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Hey.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Hey!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: How's it going down there?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Did you really?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: No. [laughs],02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Oh.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Almost.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Good.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Nice. Well, what's it all about?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Um...,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: I think you should do it. That's great!,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: It's really cool.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Angela: Are you married?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I'm divorced.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: That must have been hard.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: It was. Yes.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Phyllis: Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Angela: At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Kelly: How can someone so beautiful be so sad?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Hi.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Did you take care of the situation?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Excuse me.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jan: Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: So you're not doing it.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: How did you know?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Why not?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Come on.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: Roy said that.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: What? You have something you want to say?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?","02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Jim: You are?,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: Yeah.,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Pam: It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .",02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: I'm just going to put this over there.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Darryl: This is not a good idea right here.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: You did uh... okay.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?,"02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Hey.

Excellent.,02x15 - Boys & Girls;Michael: Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why?

[Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.","02x16 - Valentine's Day;Jim: [on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway.

Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.","02x16 - Valentine's Day;Michael: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac.

Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.","02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, ""Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...""",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: I can't do this.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.","02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Oh, okay.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.","02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: I'll try and think of one. When...,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Insult.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Pam: Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes!

I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Jim: Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Oscar: I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.","02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: But I'm right?,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?

Do you remember the speeches that you gave?,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: I do. Both of them.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Could I have a copy of one of them?,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Attention everybody! Attention please!

You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: That is so great about the bonus!,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: No, no! It's not true.

Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Stanley: Michael?,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Yeah.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Stanley: You said we were getting bonuses.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Stanley: Cancel wallpaper.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.

And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Pam: You mean Toastmasters?,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Pam! I'm public speaking.

So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Kevin: You should go to Hedonism.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Jim: What is that?,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Kevin: It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.","02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Jim: I was thinking more like Europe.

If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand.

Just trying to get some advice on my trip.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Oh please!

I am.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Jim: The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion.

And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Kevin: I always set it at 69. [snickers],02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Pam: Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Kelly: But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.

Something happened?,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Weird.,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'",02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Dwight: Con artist.,02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,"02x17 - Dwight's Speech;Michael: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?"

Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Kevin: That is so good, Michael","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Waa... what? What are you talking about?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Oscar: Is that true, Toby?","02x20 - Drug Testing;Toby: Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: No you can't do that.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: I can do that, it is my office.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.,02x20 - Drug Testing;,02x20 - Drug Testing;,02x20 - Drug Testing;,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",02x20 - Drug Testing;Kevin: I'm not taking Rogaine.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Angela, what about you?",02x20 - Drug Testing;Angela: I don't take any prescription drugs.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: You're not on anything?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Angela: [Gives Dwight a knowing look],02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Good.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Kelly: So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...","02x20 - Drug Testing;Pam: Hey guys, what's going on?","02x20 - Drug Testing;Kelly: We're having the best conversation.

Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, ""Gee, thanks, Pam.""]","02x20 - Drug Testing;Kelly: So, I was looking so hot...",02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Phyllis: We don't feel that way.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Angela: No, not at all.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Oscar: You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, ""Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.""","02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Thank you, Michael.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Stanley: Where did you get these facts?,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",02x20 - Drug Testing;Stanley: They are not.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Stanley: No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?","02x20 - Drug Testing;Toby: Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Yes it is.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Toby: No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Toby: You can't do that.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Toby: That's not random.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.

Yeah, Pam.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Pam: I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Really?

These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths ""I can't"" and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Pam: Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: No, you will be tested.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Yes, I will not be.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay?

I need some filing done.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: What kind of filing?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Just forget it. Just the urine.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: That goes directly to the tester.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Just. I need your urine.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Like in a cup?,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: For what purpose?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: It's none of your business.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Then I refuse.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Are you serious?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: I need clean urine for the lady.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: But that's illegal.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: Not my urine.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Michael: A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident.

Just... just fill up the cup.",02x20 - Drug Testing;Angela: Do you want to give Michael your urine?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: I want him to have all the urine he needs.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Angela: You're not going to get my permission on this.,02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: I know that.

Hey, are you guys hiring?",02x20 - Drug Testing;Linda: You want to work at the urinalysis lab?,02x20 - Drug Testing;Ryan: Yeah. Maybe.,"02x20 - Drug Testing;Dwight: My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.","02x20 - Drug Testing;Pam: What?

What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?

I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using ""I"" emotion language and no judging or ""you"" statements.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Angela: I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday.

I just really think we should talk about it.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Toby: Sure.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Stanley. [off camera],"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Anglea: I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible]",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Someone complained that the men's room is ""whites only"". Stanley, you know that's not true.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Stanley: I didn't say that.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Creed: Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: Stanley and I are close, too.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Stanley: We sit close.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Oh... ok.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Toby: [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: Don't take her side.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: You mean your thoughts and feelings?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: Yeah.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Yeah...,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Angela: Yes, that's the problem.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: I guess so...,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay, well... all settled, then.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: [whispering to Angela] I don't like you.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Creed: I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Kevin: I accept your decision!,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: That doesn't make any sense.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: No.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: This is humongous. I am not a security threat...,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Oh.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: What did I write?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Toby: Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: What box?!,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: But I didn't report your snoring-,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Stanley: Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Uh. Dwight.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay! Calm down.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Hey, hey!",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Him or me?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Stop.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay...,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Either he goes, or I go.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Dwight...,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: You choose!,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Stop...,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Oh... kay...,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: I am not bluffing!,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Okay?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Yes.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Mm-hmm.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: I deserve this. You know I do!,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: You have till five.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] ""Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."" [flips to another paper] ""Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.""",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [reading] ""This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."" [flips to another paper] ""Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."" Gah. ""This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.""","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [reading] ""Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.""","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: ""By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.""","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Maybe Stanford would be cool.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: It's a good market. Higher volume.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: I have a girlfriend...,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: So, you going to transfer Jim or not?","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: I want an answer by tomorrow.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Fine.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Good. Okay.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: You mean digital?,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: It'll take like two seconds.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: 20 bucks.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Stanley: You gotta be kiddin' me.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Come on, everybody.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Dwight: Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Photographer: That'll be another 20.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: What?,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [off camera] You just press the button.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Angela: What?,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: No, Pam.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Pam, it wasn't her.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: What?!,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: I'm the one who complained about you.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: You know, it was one day.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [off camera] That's terrible.,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: And I took it right back. It was like...,02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Pam: Okay.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Phyllis: Oh, dear.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,"02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: [on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Female worker: Okay, Jan will see you now.","02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Jim: Oh, thanks.",02x21 - Conflict Resolution;Michael: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, ""Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening."" Makes you feel good.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: It's a nice tux.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.","02x22 - Casino Night;Roy: So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.","02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.","02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: I can always kind of win at roulette.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Yeah.,02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: How would you do that?,02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Mind control.,02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: I don't believe you. Continue.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.","02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.","02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]","02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: Oh, my God.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: [on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Top 80 percent!,02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: Michael?,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Yeah?,02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: You know that I'm very serious here.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: What?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: I thought that you were their fearless leader.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: [laughs] I think you can handle it.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Oh, come on. Come on.","02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: I think so, Michael...","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.","02x22 - Casino Night;Jan: Goodbye, Michael.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",02x22 - Casino Night;Oscar: Again? We do that every year.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",02x22 - Casino Night;Oscar: It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: Yes!,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: That doesn't exist anymore.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.","02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: No, they stopped making that show.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Well, then, they need our money more than ever.","02x22 - Casino Night;Angela: You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.",02x22 - Casino Night;Creed: There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.,02x22 - Casino Night;Kevin: Something with animals. Or people.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Kelly: Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it.","02x22 - Casino Night;Angela: We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...","02x22 - Casino Night;Toby: Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",02x22 - Casino Night;Phyllis: Afghani.,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: What?,02x22 - Casino Night;Phyllis: Afghani.,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: That's a dog.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: No, that's Afghan.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: That's a shawl.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: Wait, canine AIDS?",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: No. Humans with AIDS.,02x22 - Casino Night;Creed: Who has AIDS?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Guys, the Afghanistananies.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. ""I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."" [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: What are you doing?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Oh, nothing.","02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: ""Till Death Do Us Rock.""",02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: They're wedding bands.,02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Oh.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.","02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.",02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: There's a KISS cover band in here.,02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Let's do it.,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.,02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: Except my warehouse.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Well, actually, it's my warehouse.","02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Why are you here?,"02x22 - Casino Night;Dwight: When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Not. I said, not that.",02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: That's ironic.,02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: What?,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: That you are afraid.,02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Dinkin' flicka.,02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: [sighs] Dinkin' flicka.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, ""Fleece it out."" ""Going mach five."" ""Dinkin' flicka."" You know, things us Negroes say.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture],"02x22 - Casino Night;Darryl: Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: [Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.,02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Yes.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Have three stages, yeah.","02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.",02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Oh.,02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Let's take a look. Nice.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: What?,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: On the drums! On the drums!,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.",02x22 - Casino Night;Kevin: We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.,02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Wow. Oh!,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Oh, my...","02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...",02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: No! No!,"02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.","02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: No, come back! No, no, no!",02x22 - Casino Night;Jim: Kev!,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: [phone rings] Yes,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: [phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.",02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Who?,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Carol Stills.,02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Do I know a Carol Stills?,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Your realtor.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?",02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: It's still me.,02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Pam: Carol, you're on with Michael.","02x22 - Casino Night;Carol: [on phone] Hello, Michael?","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Hi, Carol. How you doing?",02x22 - Casino Night;Carol: I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.,"02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.","02x22 - Casino Night;Carol: Oh, great.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.","02x22 - Casino Night;Carol: Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.","02x22 - Casino Night;Carol: Oh, great.","02x22 - Casino Night;Michael: Yeah, it'll be good.

I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: I really don't think so.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: [creepy smile],03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: That's ridiculous.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [sighs] Let's call him and get the website.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Definitely.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jim: What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem. [loudly fake typing] It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Well, they're sold out.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Damn. [thinks] I'll try Brookstone.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jim: I miss that.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Roy: Chicken or fish?,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Pam: [loud sigh] Chicken.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Roy: So you havin' a good day?,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Pam: Excellent, thanks.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Roy: Good, glad. OK.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Pam: Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Roy: After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Stanley: I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Kelly: That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Angela: Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Andy: OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: That's not what it's called.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Toby: OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: What? What does that even...,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Toby: All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: NO!,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: I don't kn--,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: No, it's not possible.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Anything's possible.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: You know, imagine... you were gay.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Jan: Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: Am I the first gay man you ever knew?,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Pam: Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [looking at gay p0rn] Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Ah damn pop-ups.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: What are you doing?!,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Angela: Watching some of your friends.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Creed:[/b]: I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Angela: Judges and juries!,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Kevin:[/b]: That sounds great.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: No one else in this office is gay.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Phyllis: I'm getting married to Bob Vance.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! [laughs] See? Everybody has a chance!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Phyllis: No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [laughing] Right! [serious] And I take that as a compliment.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Phyllis: Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: You sound pretty defensive Michael.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: No no no. The only signal that I am sending is[/b]: Gay, good.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: I would rather not.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: All right, um... sorry.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.,03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this. [awkwardly kissing Oscar] I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here. [everyone claps]","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: [Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar] Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Michael: Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.","03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: [reading the note with the gay-dar] ""Hope this helps. -Jim"" Nice!",03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Oscar: [Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body] What are you doing?!,"03x01 - Gay Witch Hunt;Dwight: Shhh. Don't be scared. [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works. [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle] ...oh no."

I am going to be a father.",03x02 - The Convention;Pam: What was Oprah about?,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",03x02 - The Convention;Pam: That's a really big decision.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: I know.,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Well...,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Or not adopt.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Just do it, okay?","03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?","03x02 - The Convention;Pam: You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Eight months?,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Yeah.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: You probably won't.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...","03x02 - The Convention;Pam: No, Michael.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Twenty years.,"03x02 - The Convention;Pam: No, Michael.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Thirty.,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Sure.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: It's a deal.,03x02 - The Convention;Ryan: All right.

Ah.,03x02 - The Convention;Angela: Sign.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Per diem.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled s*x romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.","03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Don't be mad, it is a business trip.",03x02 - The Convention;Angela: But I don't understand. It's for managers.,"03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.",03x02 - The Convention;Angela: I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?,"03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Yes, Monkey.","03x02 - The Convention;Angela: Don't ""Monkey"" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.","03x02 - The Convention;Angela: In the Martin family, we like to say, ""Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly."" That's code for ""check out the slut."" What is... why are there flies in here?","03x02 - The Convention;Kelly: Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?",03x02 - The Convention;Pam: This.,03x02 - The Convention;Kelly: You look so pretty.,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Thank you.,"03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.","03x02 - The Convention;Kelly: Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?",03x02 - The Convention;Kelly: My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.",03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: And your veil.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Yeah, do it!",03x02 - The Convention;Pam: I'll probably just wear this.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Really?

Okay, um.",03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Um.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: You got that?,03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: I got it.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Write it down.,03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: I got it.,03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Um.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Um.,"03x02 - The Convention;Dwight and Michael: [singing] Um, um, um...",03x02 - The Convention;Creed: There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?,"03x02 - The Convention;Angela: That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.",03x02 - The Convention;Meredith: That town smells like cheese steaks.,03x02 - The Convention;Angela: That town is full of history!,03x02 - The Convention;Creed: Andrea's the office bitch.

I don't even know what they mean half the time.",03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: This party is going to be awesome.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: I know!

One for the road, gentlemen?","03x02 - The Convention;Josh: A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.","03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke.

Toby?",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?,"03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.","03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Michael, it's really not a competition.",03x02 - The Convention;Josh: Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope.

Obviously, you are invited.","03x02 - The Convention;Jan: Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.","03x02 - The Convention;Phyllis: You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.","03x02 - The Convention;Stanley: If you do that, you're going to have to put out.","03x02 - The Convention;Phyllis: Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.",03x02 - The Convention;Angela: Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Any messages for 308?

Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.",03x02 - The Convention;Josh: Fine! All right.,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Okay! Excellent. Oh...,03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Keep the wing flaps.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!","03x02 - The Convention;Jim, Josh, and Dwight: Hi, Pam.","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: You first.,"03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Come on. Nice try, Josh!","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.","03x02 - The Convention;Josh: Or what?

I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",03x02 - The Convention;Evan: That is so true. Ready?,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.",03x02 - The Convention;Evan: Great.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Sorry, my meeting ran late.",03x02 - The Convention;Jan: Really?,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Yes, Jan, really.

We can now sell HammerMill products.,03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Yes! Ha!,"03x02 - The Convention;Jan: Well, Michael, I underestimated you.","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.",03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.,03x02 - The Convention;Angela: D?,"03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!","03x02 - The Convention;Kelly: So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.","03x02 - The Convention;Alan: Oh, great.",03x02 - The Convention;Ryan: I don't want ketchup.,03x02 - The Convention;Kelly: You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: So how do you come up with your cartoons?,"03x02 - The Convention;Alan: Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them.",03x02 - The Convention;Pam: You dream in cartoons? How fun!,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Hey, first guest!

Yeah.,"03x02 - The Convention;Alan: Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, ""Don't be edgy."" But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it.","03x02 - The Convention;Pam: Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.","03x02 - The Convention;Alan: Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain.",03x02 - The Convention;Pam: More freedom fries.,03x02 - The Convention;Alan: Yeah.,03x02 - The Convention;Pam: That's great.,03x02 - The Convention;Alan: Okay.,"03x02 - The Convention;Pam: I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.",03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Michael. Am I the first to arrive?,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: People have been filtering in and out.,03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Can I get a drink?,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: What?,03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Can I get a drink?,03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Sure. You like Cosmos?,03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Yeah.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Michael...,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...","03x02 - The Convention;Jim: Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss.

I transferred because of Pam.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.,"03x02 - The Convention;Jim: No, I just... I heard something about that.

Okay, maybe.",03x02 - The Convention;Evan: Are we early?,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Hey!

Now we're friends.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Best friends.,"03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Some people need dozens of friends to say, ""Hey, look at me, I'm popular."" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.","03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Ha, ha, ha, ha.",03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Whoa. What are those stains?,"03x02 - The Convention;Dwight: Blood, urine, or semen.","03x02 - The Convention;Michael: Oh, God, I hope it's urine."
03x03 - The Coup;Michael: [waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there. Second from the end.,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Alright, everybody here? Yes.",03x03 - The Coup;Pam: [walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: [with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else? Nooo.,"03x03 - The Coup;Pam: Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.",03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Entourage!,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?",03x03 - The Coup;Kevin: Yes!,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Why him?,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Don't whine. Get the window. [Dwight exhales],03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Previously on Varsity Blues...,"03x03 - The Coup;Kevin: Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...",03x03 - The Coup;Jan: [walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.,03x03 - The Coup;Angela: I don't approve. I don't.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room],03x03 - The Coup;Michael: [Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!

How on earth would it do that?,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: People work faster after...,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Magically?,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: No.,03x03 - The Coup;Angela: [walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.,"03x03 - The Coup;Angela: Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: That's not going to happen.,03x03 - The Coup;Angela: You know she has it out for him now.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!,"03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.","03x03 - The Coup;Angela: Dwight, you should be running this office.",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Michael would never let me...,"03x03 - The Coup;Angela: It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: I could never do that!,03x03 - The Coup;Angela: Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!,"03x03 - The Coup;Angela: I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.","03x03 - The Coup;Jim: At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.","03x03 - The Coup;Pam: [on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]","03x03 - The Coup;Pam: Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.",03x03 - The Coup;Pam: [pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.,03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: [gasps] I love it!,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: Really? I don't know.,"03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.","03x03 - The Coup;Pam: Not at work, I'll try it on---",03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: ...noooo,03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: [clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!,03x03 - The Coup;Andy: Why did you do that?!,"03x03 - The Coup;Jim: I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.",03x03 - The Coup;Andy: We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish.,"03x03 - The Coup;Jim: [turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?",03x03 - The Coup;Karen: [laughing] Yeah.,"03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH! GAH! [breathing heavily]",03x03 - The Coup;Jan: [answering the phone] Hello?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Is this Jan?,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Who is this?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.,"03x03 - The Coup;Jan: You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: It's about Michael.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: What about him?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [exhales] I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: It's not about a surprise party is it?,"03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: No, but we should discuss that another time.","03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.","03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.",03x03 - The Coup;Jan: How do you know I like that store?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: How do you know that?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Part of my job.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: No it's not. It's officially not.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: ...noted.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Ok.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: I have to have an emergency crown put in.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Ouchy.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Three hours, wow. Have fun.

Teddy?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: I can save the branch.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Really?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: If you let me run it.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Ok.,"03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [excitedly] ""Ok"" I can run it?",03x03 - The Coup;Jan: What would you do differently?,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. [to waitress in diner] Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.,"03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.","03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So [cutting his food, giving Jan a ""so there"" look], here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision.","03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.",03x03 - The Coup;Jan: [thinks for a second] Where is it?,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: [on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Hi.,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Oh. That's nice.,"03x03 - The Coup;Jan: No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.",03x03 - The Coup;Michael: ...what?,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: Mm-hmm.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: ...you were at the dentist?,03x03 - The Coup;Jan: You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Ok.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.,03x03 - The Coup;Phyllis: [Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.,03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: It's so sexy. You look so hot.,03x03 - The Coup;Phyllis: It's really something.,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: [smiling] It's too much.,03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: What?,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: I'm gonna return it.,"03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.",03x03 - The Coup;Roy: [walking into the break room] Hey.,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: Hi.,03x03 - The Coup;Roy: You look nice.,03x03 - The Coup;Pam: Thanks.,03x03 - The Coup;Kelly: Isn't that like your third soda today?,"03x03 - The Coup;Jim: Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.

Sounds a lot like dentist.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Maybe that's why he became a dentist.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em.

I am glad you're ok.,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.

We don't have the technology.","03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?","03x03 - The Coup;Michael: [in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: What?,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Ohhhh.

I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!

But I'm gonna keep the clothes.

You've always admired it.,"03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.",03x03 - The Coup;Michael: [Michael finally breaks] Take it back.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [confused] No.,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: That's my car.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: What did you---,03x03 - The Coup;Michael: THAT'S MY CAR.,03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: Yes.,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: I know, Dwight.

I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.,"03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?",03x03 - The Coup;Dwight: [Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.

What can I do?","03x03 - The Coup;Michael: You can get up. Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch. [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]","03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.","03x03 - The Coup;Jim: [leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]","03x03 - The Coup;Karen: [throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]","03x03 - The Coup;Michael: Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with ""LIAR"" written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year."

[continues to laugh] Whoo!,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: There you go, fresh from the warehouse.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Ryan and others: Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: [breathless] All right. Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.

Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: Michael, Ed died over the weekend.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Oh, wow.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Kelly: Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Phyllis: That's a shame.

Cheer me up.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: So did you hear the news?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: The news that you just announced? That Ed died?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yeah.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Is there anything I can do?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?

They're just out of Herr's chips.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Oh.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Creed: It's a real shame about Ed, huh?",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Creed: About what?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Creed: Ed was decapitated.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: What?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: Really?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Creed: He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Oh my God.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Creed: You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: You're thinking of a chicken.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Creed: What did I say?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: [clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: Ed was decapitated.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: What are you doing?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: You said you didn't know how to say it.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: Hey.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Angela: Hi.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Angela: I do not wanna talk about this.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: [on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: Well, what would you suggest?",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: [thoughtfully] A statue.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: Of Ed?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yeah.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: [scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: No, that's not---","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: That is not a statue, that is a robot.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: I think that is a great way to honor Ed.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: And how big do you want this robot?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Life-size.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: What the hell are you two talking about?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today...",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Mm hm.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: ...and I have to get back to work.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: But Ed truck can't because he is---,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jan: Goodbye. [hangs up],03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: DEAD.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: That's perfect.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Okay, that is a ""no"" on the on the West Side Market.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now?",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Really?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: Yeah, all day.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Andy: Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Andy: Did you check the vending machine?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that?",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: I have no idea. We went right for the copier.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: Mm.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: And then we checked the fax machine.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: Yeah, nothing there.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Andy: Did you check your... butt?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;,03x04 - Grief Counseling;,03x04 - Grief Counseling;,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Phyllis: Okay that's enough.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: What?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Stanley: We do not wanna hear about this.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Stanley: You have just spit on my face.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Roy: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Okay, fine. Hurry back.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Roy: [as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the ""grief counseling"" session.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Oh. I would like a break.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Roy: How are you likin' the new car?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Great.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Roy: Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Roy: [laughs] Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: [on phone] Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back.

Um...",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: You waited for me?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: [grabbing ball] I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Stanley: [throwing ball back] Nope.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: [returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Stanley: I will NOT. [throws ball back],03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Ryan: [catching ball] Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Do you want to talk about it anymore?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Ryan: Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Kevin: Me, me, me, me, me me.

And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so...",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.

No! We are not done.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Angela: We really have a lot of work to do right now.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Toby: Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: How do you know?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Toby: What?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Toby: It was obvious...,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't.

And now we are going to honor it.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Angela: But...,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone.

What are you doing?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: What? No, this is about the right size.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.

[runs off],03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Karen: [spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: Where'd I find what?,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Jim: I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Glad you could all make it.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Kelly: You told us we had to.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Dwight, do you have the box?","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: Actually, I have it.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: You made this? Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Ryan: When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking ""I'm a little too old for this."" And I was five.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Yes.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: What do we know about this bird? You might think, ""Not much. It's just a bird."" But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Kevin: Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny.","03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: He's not a songbird.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Shhh.,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Angela: [quickly] Amen.,03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: [begins playing recorder],03x04 - Grief Counseling;Pam: [singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...,"03x04 - Grief Counseling;Michael: Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.",03x04 - Grief Counseling;Dwight: Let's get back to work.
03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?,03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: A dime and a nickel.,"03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: No, I said one of them is not a nickel.",03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: But the other one is. I've heard that before.,"03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...",03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.,03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: A man is found hanging from the ceiling...,"03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.",03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: A hunter.,03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.,03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Damn it!,03x05 - Initiation;Jan: Tell me what you did yesterday.,03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Uhhh... nothing.,03x05 - Initiation;Jan: Nothing?,"03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",03x05 - Initiation;Jan: I don't care how your day was Michael.,"03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",03x05 - Initiation;Jan: Tell me what you did yesterday.,03x05 - Initiation;Michael: I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?,"03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.","03x05 - Initiation;Jan: Hi, Pam.",03x05 - Initiation;Pam: Hi.,"03x05 - Initiation;Jan: I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?","03x05 - Initiation;Pam: Oh, I don't know if I'm...",03x05 - Initiation;Jan: Thanks Pam.,"03x05 - Initiation;Pam: It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.",03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: So you excited?,03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Yeah.,03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Very excited?,03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Yes. I'm very excited.,03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.,"03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?","03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.",03x05 - Initiation;Karen: [squeaky chair] Hey.,03x05 - Initiation;Jim: What?,03x05 - Initiation;Karen: My chair is squeaking.,03x05 - Initiation;Jim: Is it?,03x05 - Initiation;Karen: You took my chair.,"03x05 - Initiation;Jim: No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.","03x05 - Initiation;Karen: When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...",03x05 - Initiation;Jim: So I guess I can't get up.,"03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Do you know where we are, temp?",03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: I know where we're not.,"03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.","03x05 - Initiation;Andy: Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.",03x05 - Initiation;Jim: Sure.,03x05 - Initiation;Andy: Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,03x05 - Initiation;Karen: That's it? That's what you came up with?,03x05 - Initiation;Andy: I'm acting my heart out here.,03x05 - Initiation;Karen: Really?,"03x05 - Initiation;Andy: Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.","03x05 - Initiation;Announcer: Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.",03x05 - Initiation;Pam: Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.,"03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.","03x05 - Initiation;Michael: [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.",03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: I don't think you know what you're saying.,"03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?",03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Uh huh.,03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.,03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Gotcha.,"03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back.",03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.,"03x05 - Initiation;Stanley: I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.",03x05 - Initiation;Kelly: Because they acted all tough and everything...,03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Uh huh.,"03x05 - Initiation;Kelly: But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...","03x05 - Initiation;Michael: [Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey!

I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,03x05 - Initiation;Michael: I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,"03x05 - Initiation;Pam: Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.","03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.","03x05 - Initiation;Pam: You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.","03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,"03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.",03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Yeah.,03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Come on!,03x05 - Initiation;Stanley: Thank you! [takes pretzel],03x05 - Initiation;Michael: Hi.

What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?","03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Um, loneliness. Maybe women.","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes.

So what is the deal?","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Establish time frames. Keep the phrase ""real dollars"" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.","03x05 - Initiation;Ryan: Wait, can you go back?","03x05 - Initiation;Dwight: Michael always said, K.I.S.S.

But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything!

Do you mean like, is Pam going?",03x06 - Diwali;Angela: Don't go. They eat monkey brains.,03x06 - Diwali;Michael: Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.,"03x06 - Diwali;Michael: It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.",03x06 - Diwali;Stanley: I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.,03x06 - Diwali;Michael: Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.,"03x06 - Diwali;Michael: I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.","03x06 - Diwali;Michael: Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus.

This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.",03x06 - Diwali;Jim: Sorry.,"03x06 - Diwali;Jim: I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do.

Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.",03x06 - Diwali;Karen: Thanks.,03x06 - Diwali;Josh: And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.,03x06 - Diwali;Karen: Got it.,"03x06 - Diwali;Jim: Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.",03x06 - Diwali;Andy: You guys ready to party?,03x06 - Diwali;Jim: What's that?,03x06 - Diwali;Andy: I said are you ready TO PARTY!,03x06 - Diwali;Phyllis: Isn't this fun?

Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch ""Lazy Scranton"".",03x08 - The Merger;Video: [Lazy Scranton Video],"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.","03x08 - The Merger;Dwight: Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",03x08 - The Merger;Michael: So check out how we live,03x08 - The Merger;Michael & Dwight: in the Electric City!,03x08 - The Merger;Michael: They call it Scranton.,03x08 - The Merger;Dwight: What?,03x08 - The Merger;Michael: The Electric City.

I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.,03x08 - The Merger;Michael: People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.'

I have to quit.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what...

But I will win... the next battle.,03x08 - The Merger;Hannah: Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.,03x08 - The Merger;Angela: Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",03x08 - The Merger;Stanley: Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.,03x08 - The Merger;Michael: No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.","03x08 - The Merger;Michael: Hey! Hey, everybody!

You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!""",03x08 - The Merger;Hannah: For crying out loud.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it.

He said he'd fill all our tires up.,03x08 - The Merger;Karen: Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!",03x08 - The Merger;Jan: Michael!,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: Hi, Jan!",03x08 - The Merger;Jan: Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?,03x08 - The Merger;Michael: I did.

Bad advice from my Number Two.,"03x08 - The Merger;Jan: What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",03x08 - The Merger;Michael: What?,03x08 - The Merger;Jan: He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.,"03x08 - The Merger;Michael: Yes, I know that.

You're going to sit in the back?,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Dwight: Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: Here we go.,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael.

It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: Hawkman.,03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.,03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.,03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Jim: After you sir.,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Dwight: No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Jim: Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Dwight: Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Pam: Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Angela: This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.,03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Pam: That's great.,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Angela: Yes, it is.

It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Buyer: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: No.,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: Stop it.

Don't worry about it.",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: I really 'Schruted' it.,03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: What?,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Andy: 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.,03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Phyllis: It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.,"03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Karen: Yeah, thank you.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Phyllis: Hey, how's Annie?","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Kenny: Oh, she's great.

Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: No, you are remembering it wrong.","03x13 - Traveling Salesmen;Michael: Dwight betrayed me once before.

I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me.

I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.","03x14 - The Return;Karen: Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.",03x14 - The Return;Jim: Fine. Party pooper.,03x14 - The Return;Michael: Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something.

It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.,"03x14 - The Return;Dwight: Oh my God, she told you?","03x14 - The Return;Michael: Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",03x14 - The Return;Dwight: Accepted.,03x14 - The Return;Michael: How's this place treating you?,03x14 - The Return;Dwight: [scoffs] The boss isn't funny.,"03x14 - The Return;Michael: Oh, well.",03x14 - The Return;Dwight: I don't get to wear my ties.,03x14 - The Return;Michael: No. I'm sure.,03x14 - The Return;Dwight: So?,"03x14 - The Return;Michael: So, maybe you should come back.

I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]",03x14 - The Return;Michael: It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,"03x14 - The Return;Andy: So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.","03x14 - The Return;Marcy: Oh, hi. You must be Andy.","03x14 - The Return;Andy: Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be...

One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines ""wedding"" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride ""Mawige...","03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.","03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob.

That's enough.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: is a guy that...,"03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Bob Vance: Thanks, Michael. Give me...","03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: he works...

I hate you!,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Jim: Hey.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Pam: Hey!,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Jim: When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Pam: Oh... I'm pacing myself.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Jim: Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Pam: No. I'm such a dorky dancer.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Jim: I know.

I'm really happy I'm with Karen.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Karen: [sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...,"03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Women: One... Two... Three. Ahhhh!

We are a great team.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Uncle Al: The Celtics were a great team.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Uncle Al: Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know!,"03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.",03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Phyllis: You found Uncle Al!,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.,"03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Phyllis: Thank you, Michael.",03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: You're... You're welcome.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.,03x16 - Phyllis' Wedding;Michael: Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other's face] Oh wow!

I'd be stupid not to do it, right?","03x17 - Business School;Michael: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.",03x17 - Business School;Michael: Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?,"03x17 - Business School;Dwight: ""Don't be an idiot.""

And if they would, I do not do that thing.","03x17 - Business School;Michael: Will they throw their hats, you think?",03x17 - Business School;Ryan: What?,"03x17 - Business School;Michael: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.",03x17 - Business School;Ryan: Y-You understand nobody's graduating.,"03x17 - Business School;Michael: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: ""May your hats fly as high as your dreams."" ... That was a pretty good line.",03x17 - Business School;Ryan: ...It doesn't apply.,"03x17 - Business School;Michael: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!

Poop!,03x17 - Business School;Jim: Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.,"03x17 - Business School;Dwight: At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.",03x17 - Business School;Jim: I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...,03x17 - Business School;Dwight: What? What's so wierd?,"03x17 - Business School;Jim: The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...

And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing.

I... bizarre.,03x17 - Business School;Dwight: No... no. One crisis at a time.,"03x17 - Business School;Dwight: If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a ""sylvania."" Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.","03x17 - Business School;Michael: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?","03x17 - Business School;Toby: Oh, this looks great.

No, you should go.","03x17 - Business School;Toby: Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.","03x17 - Business School;Michael: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay.

Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.","03x17 - Business School;Business Student #1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?","03x17 - Business School;Michael: We can't overestimate the value of computers.

Staples, Officemax...","03x17 - Business School;Michael: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning.

That's feces.",03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: What are you looking for? You bring dip?,"03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.",03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.,03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.,03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: Over our love.,03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: I've never told you that I love you.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: You don't have to, Jan.

Please stop that, ok?","03x18 - Cocktails;Rachel: Can I get anyone anything, or?",03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: I could go for an appeteaser.,03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: Martini please.,03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: Bagel bites or something.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Karen: Rachel, your house is beautiful.",03x18 - Cocktails;Rachel: Thank you.,03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: What's the square footage?,"03x18 - Cocktails;David: About 5,000.",03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: Does that include the garage?,"03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.",03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: I'm just...,03x18 - Cocktails;David: I don't know,03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: It's a common question.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: David, how much did this house cost?","03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: These old colonials are great, when they're sound.

Take care.","03x18 - Cocktails;Karen: Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.",03x18 - Cocktails;Jim: Oh.

It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.,"03x18 - Cocktails;David: What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?",03x18 - Cocktails;Jim: I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.",03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: What?,03x18 - Cocktails;Pam: I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.,03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: That's awesome. That's what I want.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Pam: Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.","03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.",03x18 - Cocktails;Pam: Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.,03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: What?,"03x18 - Cocktails;Pam: He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.",03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: Jim came on to you?,03x18 - Cocktails;Pam: Just listen.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: No, I am listening!

It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.","03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.",03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: Please don't cry.,03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.","03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: I didn't mean it. I was...,03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: Whatever.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.","03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: That's all, you didn't mean it?",03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Michael: I love you, Jan.",03x18 - Cocktails;Jan: Ok.,"03x18 - Cocktails;Dwight: Don't break up you guys, you're great together.",03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: Are they going to call the cops?,"03x18 - Cocktails;Kenny: No, I paid them off.",03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: Jet ski money?,03x18 - Cocktails;Kenny: All of it.,03x18 - Cocktails;Roy: I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.

[Roy lunges towards Jim],03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: ROY!,03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: [shrieks],03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy],03x19 - The Negotiation;Roy: [screams in pain] Ahh God!,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: Pam, please call security!","03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No need for consternation, everything is under control.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: [sigh] Is Toby there?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No...,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: I'm... here, Jan.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Thank God.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: All right, well are you gonna take care of this?",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Yeppers.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: What did I tell you about ""yeppers?""",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I don't... remember.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Yeesh...,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Okay. Um... Got you something.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: Don't want it.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: You don't know what it is.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Oscar: Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Kevin: Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Oscar: It was crazy.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: You saw it? Describe it please.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Oscar: Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: Oh...,03x19 - The Negotiation;Oscar: It was insane!,03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: [flustered] Well... good for Dwight.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Where'd you get that?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Wikipedia.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should...

Um...",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Okay.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Walking out of the room unexpectedly.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: And what happens in this one?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: It's a surprise.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Okay.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Go ahead, ask me for a raise.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Can I have a raise?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [gets up and begins to walk out of the room],"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: [softly] s*x, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: What?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: What?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, what did you say?",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Which is where?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Thanks Dwight.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: I can't imagine what I would have done.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: Well that was funny, that's why.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: Oh it was?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: Mm-hmm.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...",03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: Okay.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: ...and you call me, to calm you down...",03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: You know what? I didn't---,03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Can you stop...,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...","03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...",03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Guys...,03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: You ready for me?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Cool.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Okay.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [long pause] I am declining to speak first.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: What?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, this is a power suit.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: That there's a woman's suit.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: I'ma call Roy, man.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Ohh... kay.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: This is gonna make him feel better.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: All right.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: This is too good.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!",03x19 - The Negotiation;Kevin: You're wearing a woman's suit?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Kevin: Who makes it?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Phyllis: Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Okay.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Phyllis: Did you see...,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Would you stop it, please?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: So, none of that tipped you off?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: It's European, OK? It's a European cut.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, they don't. See? [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]","03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: [Laughing, covering her mouth]",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Italians don't wear pockets.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Okay, can you just stand right there? [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Kevin: Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: I feel great, Kevin. Thank you.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Stanley: You must have been scared out of your mind.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: Mm-hmm.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: [flustered] Goodness.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [mumbles jibberish],03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: What? I can't hear you.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [mumbling softly] That was a very good point.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.,03x19 - The Negotiation;,03x19 - The Negotiation;,03x19 - The Negotiation;,03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: Sorry I almost got you killed.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Yeah, that was nuts.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Pam: Jim... I am really... sorry.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Why can't I just... tell you?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: There you go.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Oh. [scoffs] Come on. Be serious.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Come on, be for real Mike.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: [laughs] Are you serious? You're earning this?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Plus perks, yes.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Fourteen years.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Ho-ho!,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, please, please...","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Ok, let's take 15, again.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Boy I---,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Dwight: No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jim: Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?",03x19 - The Negotiation;Karen: Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Kevin: Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Oh, thank you.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Kevin: Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...,03x19 - The Negotiation;Creed: Here's the $40 you gave me.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I didn't give you $40.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Creed: In a way you did.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Stanley: Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: [on cell phone] Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. [laughing] Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later. [hangs up]","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: What?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Well what am I supposed to do?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [exhales] That's true.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: You know what? I should.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Yeah, you should.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I have been a loyal employee for a long time.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Fourteen years long.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: You know what? I deserve a bump.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Make it happen, cap'in.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: I am makin' it happen, sergeant.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Creed: I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---",03x19 - The Negotiation;Angela: You're useless.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Mm-hm.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Jan: No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.

Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: [sighs] Fine.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: You are so mean.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: I don't know what you're talking about.,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: No, I said your idea was stupid.","03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Toby, come on. Let's go.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Where?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.",03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?,03x19 - The Negotiation;Toby: Alright.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.,03x19 - The Negotiation;Ryan: Don't you see why that's insane?,"03x19 - The Negotiation;Kelly: Oh, so I'm crazy now?","03x19 - The Negotiation;Darryl: Comfortable, Mike?",03x19 - The Negotiation;Michael: Yeah.

Sorry.,03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs],"03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.",03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Mornin' Jim.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: Hey, Andy. How are you, man?",03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Good. Drew.,03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: What's that?,03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Dr--- You can call me Drew.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: No, I'm not gonna call you that.",03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do.,03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: Andy.,03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight. How's it goin' man?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.","03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.","03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.","03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: Ok, tell him that's not true.",03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.,03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: You guys...,"03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!","03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: [half-heartedly] Andy! Nah, that's too far.",03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: Damn you.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.","03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Now, this is the forklift. You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. ... Quiz! Mike.",03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Hmm.,03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Should you drive the forklift?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: I can, and I have.","03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?",03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: You're not allowed to drive the forklift.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: It's not safe, you don't have a license.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.",03x20 - Safety Training;Madge: Madge.,03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: I thought your name was Pudge?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Madge: No, it's always been Madge.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Okay. Um, her.","03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Her. Yes, ""her"" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Ah, fine.",03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Do you understand that?,03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Yeeesh.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: [barely keeping his composure] ""Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"" [laughs]",03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.,03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.,03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: Yeah!,03x20 - Safety Training;Andy: It's on!,03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?,03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Bail'er? I hardly know her.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man.",03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody?,03x20 - Safety Training;Kevin: Five bucks says it's over 50.,03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: You really wanna bet?,03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Anybody?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Kevin: Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.",03x20 - Safety Training;Guy: How many?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: Ok, you're on.","03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?",03x20 - Safety Training;Kevin: [mouths] Damn...,"03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: [in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...","03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'.",03x20 - Safety Training;Kevin: On what?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Jim: I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.",03x20 - Safety Training;Kevin: Nice.,03x20 - Safety Training;Oscar: What are you guys talkin' about?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, Michael, should not go anywhere near them.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...",03x20 - Safety Training;Darry: It would be the worst thing in the world! It would! Very much so.,03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: What the hell is wrong with this man?,03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: It's a big red trash compactor!,03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: What are you---,03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!,03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: Don't disrespect the baler!,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions...",03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: No do not touch it!,03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: ...would I go near---,"03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!","03x20 - Safety Training;Toby: Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and...","03x20 - Safety Training;Toby: Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?",03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Take them at the same time.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?","03x20 - Safety Training;Toby: No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.",03x20 - Safety Training;Ryan: What about a long sleeve T?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Toby: Well, that'll work.",03x20 - Safety Training;Kevin: Long johns? A shaw?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Toby: You know, anything that warms you.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. [to warehouse guys] Sorry, he is very lame. [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see. ""Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.""",03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.","03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Actually, you did.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. ""A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---""",03x20 - Safety Training;Toby: Sedentary.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Yes. ""Which can contribute to heart disease."" Heart disease kills more people that balers.","03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: That's called having a fat butt, Michael.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...","03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: Yeah, yeah.

Please apologize.",03x20 - Safety Training;Kelly: Are you kidding me?,"03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: Alright, we outta here.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---","03x20 - Safety Training;Lonny: Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.","03x20 - Safety Training;Darryl: That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there.

Never havin' to risk it.","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.

Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.,03x20 - Safety Training;Pam: Yeah...,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...",03x20 - Safety Training;Pam: It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.","03x20 - Safety Training;Pam: So, you're okay?",03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Indubitably.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: They use props.

Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.,"03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: You may be asking yourself, ""What am I doing on a trampoline?"" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, ""Hey! You ever seen a suicide?"" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note[/b]: They might think ""Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael."" But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da! [Dwight nods]","03x20 - Safety Training;Kelly: So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome. [Karen lays money down on the desk next to Ryan] And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, [Phyllis throws her money down] but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? [Creed throws his money down] What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually [Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works? [Jim throws his money down]","03x20 - Safety Training;Ryan: I guess I forgot.

Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said ""awesome"" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.","03x20 - Safety Training;Dwight: [on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!","03x20 - Safety Training;Michael: Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style.

You do not want to receive three of those.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Lay it on me.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Now that sounds serious.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Which would be me.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: That is correct.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: What's a dis... what's that?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Oh, you don't want to know.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: I think I just got flashed.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: What? Really?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: In the parking lot.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Oh, my God.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: OK, I'll call the real police.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Andy: What happened? What can I do to help?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: [on the phone] OK.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Andy: I'll check the web.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: Phyllis. You're a married woman.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Creed: The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Creed: If that's flashing, then lock me up.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Ryan: [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering],03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: What's happening?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Really? Is she OK?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: What is so funny?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: I'm guessing not.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Mm... not really, no.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: It's disgusting and demeaning.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down],03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: What's going on?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: I don't think the women in this office -,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: I was at a parent-teacher conference.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your pen1s. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jan: [on speakerphone] Michael, ...",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Huh?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jan: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jan: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jan: $300?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I... uh, well, I don't know.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jan: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Hunter: [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Look at that one.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his pen1s - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Phallus?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: I didn't really get a good look.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] ""Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute."" This is ridiculous.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Desperate times call for desperate measures.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: [reads memo] ""Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors."" Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: [eating banana] Mm, less than three.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: That is not current.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Creed: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Meredith: I don't remember doing that.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: What a surprise.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Alien. Blagh!,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Andy: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: I'm saying that you're being sexist.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: That - it's the same thing.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: Michael.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Yes.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: I wish I could menstruate.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Can we just get back to work?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Ye - OK, yes.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: This is not work talk.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Have you finished with the sketch?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Yeah.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Uh, Phyllis got a good look.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Hmm.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: [tires screeching] Oh.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Meredith: Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window],"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Meredith: My car, my rules.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: No. Thank you, though.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: You aren't curious?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Go crazy.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Andy: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Andy: This guy looks like a real deviant.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Andy: Aye, aye, Cap'n.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: More like, ""Aye, aye, General.""",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: [Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping],03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Meredith: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Many women are competent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Dwight: [marks Scranton with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we know.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: Yes.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Anna Maria's.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Ryan: What's the occasion?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Six-month anniversary. What?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Ryan: Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: No, we've been dating for six months.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Ryan: Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Ryan: I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kelly: Thanks, Michael.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: Thank you, Michael.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: What do you want to dish about?,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it ""shmear?"" Like the cream cheese.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kelly: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: What, um... what do you think of role-play?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: Oh, it can be fun.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: It's a pretty common one.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Oh, my God.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: That is not healthy behavior.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Michael, you need to get out of this.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Read the pros first.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: She does have very nice clothes.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: OK, OK. Um, cons.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts[/b]: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: What was the last one?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: No, the one before that.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I'm unhappy when I'm with her.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having s*x.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Yeah, that's smart.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: My mom taught me that.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: No one said it has no calories.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Toby: I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Creed: What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: You're in here.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Creed: I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall],03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kevin: [all get up to leave] OK.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Creed: [wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Phyllis: Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles],03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Angela: [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply] It's Jan. What do I do?",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Karen: Answer it.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Don't answer it.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: OK, it stopped.",03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kelly: [bang] Whoa.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Meredith: [tires screeching] Crap.,03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Jim: [snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.,"03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Kelly: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Pam: Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.","03x22 - Women's Appreciation;Michael: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right.

My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello?",03x23 - Beach Games;Kevin: Why don't you go Michael?,03x23 - Beach Games;Michael: Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.,"03x23 - Beach Games;Jim: And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.","03x23 - Beach Games;Michael: Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.

So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.","03x23 - Beach Games;Jim: Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.",03x23 - Beach Games;Michael: You are being too modest.,"03x23 - Beach Games;Jim: Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.","03x23 - Beach Games;Michael: Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.","03x23 - Beach Games;Dwight: The Aristocrats.

Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.","03x23 - Beach Games;Michael: Pam, that was amazing.

I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful.

And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",04x09 - Local Ad;Jim: You playing that game again?,"04x09 - Local Ad;Dwight: Second Life is not a game.

I have a small problem.",04x09 - Local Ad;Ryan: I told you not to call about small problems.,"04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.","04x09 - Local Ad;Ryan: That's good. They're creative, you're not.","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: I'm creative, Ryan.","04x09 - Local Ad;Ryan: It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.","04x09 - Local Ad;Ryan: Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set.

I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.","04x09 - Local Ad;Ad guy 2: Okay, when should we come back?","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: How about never hundred hours, sir.",04x09 - Local Ad;Ad guy 2: We were sent here to help out.,04x09 - Local Ad;Ad guy 1: Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy.

I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office.

[clapping and cheering],04x09 - Local Ad;Bartender: Hey it seemed like a big hit.,"04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.","04x09 - Local Ad;Jim: Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?","04x09 - Local Ad;Jim: Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael's Ad: [Chariots of Fire theme plays] It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. [people passing a Corporate Memo around to each other] Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world. [Kelly catches paper airplane that says ""I love you""] And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time [newspaper with Andy saying ""Hometown Boy Wins Race""], and bad news isn't always what it seems. [Dwight hands Phyllis paper that says ""You have a son, and it's me""] Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. [Stanley finds paper that says ""Turn your life around. Now hiring at Dunder Mifflin""] To score. [Jim throws paper in basket, Michael retrieves it; it says ""World's Most Creative Boss""] Dunder Mifflin.

[puts his arm around Pam],"04x09 - Local Ad;Kevin: Michael, that was fun.","04x09 - Local Ad;Michael: That was fun.

[knocks on door]",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Yeah.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Rolando: Karen? He's on line one.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton?",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?",04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: This is perfect.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Dwight: He looks like your twin.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Dwight: I will know.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: But, you will not tell anyone.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Dwight: I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. [knock on the door] Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",04x10 - Branch Wars;Stanley: I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Just go out, and come back in.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Stanley: I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: What?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",04x10 - Branch Wars;All: [applause],"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",04x10 - Branch Wars;Stanley: I think it's because of my sales record.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: That could not possibly be it.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: How can I get you to stay?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Stanley: Money.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Yeah we all want money.

We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Oscar: Besides having s*x with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Pam: Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Oscar?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Pam: Some people.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: [on phone] Hello?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Fillipellers, how's it hanging?",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Michael...,04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: To the left?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Listen, I-",04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: To the right?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: I'm-,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: You called me.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Toby's not a salesperson.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Karen: Oooh. Good-bye Michael.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one? [Karen hangs up]","04x10 - Branch Wars;Pam: I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Hi Ben, Michael Scott.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Ben: Hi Michael.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.

[to Ben] Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Ben: Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?","04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?",04x10 - Branch Wars;Ben: Seriously?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch.

Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: So what are you going to do?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Did they?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?","04x10 - Branch Wars;Pam: It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.","04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: We just passed the exit for Corcroan.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: What? What? We did?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Dwight and Michael: Surprise!

Utica!,04x10 - Branch Wars;Michael: In your face,04x10 - Branch Wars;Dwight: Yow!,04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: I can't believe you guys.

A time of refinement, and civility.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Pam: [nods head yes],"04x10 - Branch Wars;Andy: Oh-oh, come on!","04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: [Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.

I thought was uh, a fun read.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Toby: Fun?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Mm-hmm.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Toby: Really?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Yeah.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Toby: What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins?,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: No, that wasn't fun.",04x10 - Branch Wars;Toby: Did you even read it?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Of course I read it.,04x10 - Branch Wars;Oscar: How does it end?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Toby: Who was the main character?,04x10 - Branch Wars;Jim: Angela. Nope. The ashes.,"04x10 - Branch Wars;Pam: [mouths ""I'm sorry"" to Oscar]"

[in a singing voice] Anything can happen.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Toby: Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Morning.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Toby: Michael.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a ""get to know you"" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: Did you sleep in cabins?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Toby: Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Phyllis: Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Phyllis: Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: Who went?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Toby: Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, ""No more s'mores, no more s'mores."" [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]","04x11 - Survivor Man;Toby: Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: [from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Toby: Michael wasn't invited.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Got it.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Absolutely, yes.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Really?,04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Yeah?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Oh, you wanna go today?",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: And I am always busy.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: How often can you actually donate blood?,04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Is there a limit?,04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Your body only has a certain amount.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Well, is that it? Or?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: How so?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: What's that?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Right.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Not gonna change.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: I thought we had that looked at.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called ""Survivorman."" And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: [winks] I'm on it. [leaves room],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.

[clears the front of Michael's desk],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, ""Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place."" Well I say, ""It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.""","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Dwight and I are going out.

The choice is yours.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days.

Let's put it this way[/b]: no, I do not.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: I would make sure that you were dead.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Well...,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: You...,04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: What are you doing?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: It would be better if you were unconscious.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: Do you want to do this right or not?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: I do remember, yeah.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: What?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: [flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to ""Happy Birthday."" And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: [flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!",04x11 - Survivor Man;Kelly: Ahhh!!

[Michael laughs],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: I don't like it. [Angela leaves],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: Do you think it's a good idea?,04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: No... I think it's a great idea.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: [smiles] Hmm.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: We're here. [gets out of the car],04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: You know, try sending them another invoice.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Oscar: Ok.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Alright.

This is really cool.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Right? I was just thinking...,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Oscar: No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you.

Dwight, Dwight. Just --",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: I'm just --,04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Stop.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction.

She'll know what that means.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...","04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat],"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Andy: Tuna.

Fudgie the Whale.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Not your birthday.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Andy: Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Andy: Wow, OK, harsh.

Doesn't even matter.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Dwight: About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday.

It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Kevin: Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Stanley: I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Oscar: Why don't you just have an apple?,04x11 - Survivor Man;Stanley: Why don't you mind your business?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Creed: Listen, I figured this out.

We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter.

I don't see the harm in that.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?","04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding.

'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Pam: [raises hand] Conference room?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Angela: What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?',"04x11 - Survivor Man;Kevin: Oh, I'll take 'em.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Creed: Well nobody's touching my cobbler.,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Phyllis: [raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load.

No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]",04x11 - Survivor Man;Everybody: Happy Birthday to you.

You're gonna break something.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Man became civilized for a reason.

Rookie mistake.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: You did do it?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.","04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.",04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: That's what I said. That's what she said.,04x11 - Survivor Man;Jim: That's what who said?,"04x11 - Survivor Man;Michael: I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension.
